	<blockquote>"NO COMPROMISES NO FEAR OF FAILURE" ~ <i>Christian Von Koenigsegg</i></blockquote>
	<p><b>The Koenigsegg Regera is a limited production, plug-in hybrid grand touring sports car manufactured by Swedish automotive manufacturer Koenigsegg. It was unveiled at the March 2015 Geneva Motor Show.</b></p>
	<p><i>The Regera has a reported total power output of 1,340 kW (1,797 hp; 1,822 PS) through a hybrid powertrain. As in general, the Regera's internal combustion engine (ICE) generates its greatest power only at high rpm; however, due to the fixed gear, this corresponds to very high speeds. Power at low speeds is filled in by the electric motors, giving a maximum combined mechanical power output of 1,119 kW (1,500 hp; 1,521 PS) and 2,000 N⋅m (1,475 lb⋅ft) of torque.</i></p><br/>
